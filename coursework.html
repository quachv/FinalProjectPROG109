<h3>PROG 109 - Introduction to Web Development</h3>
Instructor: Maricel Medina-Mora
<br>Number of Credits: 5
<p>This class gives an introduction of basic programming techniques used in web development. We write and design different computer instructions to solve business problems, learn programming, develop graphical user interface that uses events and objects. 
<p>Before this class, I had some basic HTML and Javascript experience from a past class I took when I was at the University of Washington. After this class, I feel like I have a better understanding of the topic. With the repetition of creating different webpages every week, I what the code as to have in order to work properly.

<p><h3>BUSIT 209 - Data Visualization</h3>
<br>Instructor: Art Lovestedt
<br>Number of Credits: 5
<p>This class gives an introduction on how to create effective data visualizations. These visualizations are then used to help understand different business problems and help with making difficult business decisions. Instead of focusing on the numbers and data itself, this course helps students see information in a more quantitative way. 
<p>Before this class, I didn't work a lot with data visualization. A lot the work I did before was collecting data and creating it into a report so that people can look at the raw data and some total of certain numbers. I have always thought data reporting was one dimensional where it was just about the numbers and information. After this class, I realize that there is more than just numbers in data reporting. Even though it is easy to throw the data into a chart or graph, you still have to understand the data and how all the information is connected with one another to create a meaningful visualization.
